// We can follow the below structure to efficently manage the real time application and with the three environments as everything Mentioned below

1. Main Branches:
   - `main`: Represents the production-ready state.
   - `develop`: The main development branch where features are integrated.

2. Supporting Branches:
   - Feature branches
   - Release branches
   - Hotfix branches

3. Feature Development:
   - Create a new feature branch from `develop`: `feature/feature-name`
   - Develop the feature in this branch
   - When complete, create a pull request to merge back into `develop`
   - After code review, merge the feature branch into `develop`

4. Release Process:
   - When `develop` has enough features for a release, create a release branch: `release/vX.Y.Z`
   - This branch is deployed to the staging environment for testing
   - Bug fixes related to the release are made directly in this branch
   - Once stable, merge the release branch into both `main` and `develop`
   - Tag the merge in `main` with the version number

5. Hotfix Process:
   - For critical bugs in production, create a hotfix branch from `main`: `hotfix/bug-description`
   - Fix the bug in this branch
   - Once fixed, merge the hotfix into both `main` and `develop`
   - Tag the merge in `main` with an updated version number


6. Environment Management:
   - Development: The `develop` branch is continuously deployed to the dev environment
   - Staging: Release branches are deployed to the staging environment for testing
   - Production: The `main` branch is deployed to the production environment
