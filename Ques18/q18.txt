We can use git reflog command which shows the history of all actions related to branch movements, 
including commit hashes and changes. We can use this command to find the commit hashes related to the deleted branch. 
Look for entries that represent the commits you want to recover.

Steps to be followed to recover the deleted branch are -

--> git reflog
There are two case :
    1. If the deleted branch contained multiple commits and you want to recover the entire branch, create a new branch from the specific commit

--> git checkout -b <branch-name> <git-commit-SHA>

    2. If you only need to recover specific commits from the deleted branch rather than the entire branch, we can use git cherry-pick

--> git checkout <branch-name>
--> git cherry-pick <git-commit-SHA>
