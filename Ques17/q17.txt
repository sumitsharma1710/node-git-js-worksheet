The below Steps need to be followed in order to remove the .env file from everywhere

1. Add the .env file in the gitignore file in your local system
2. Now run the following command - 
       "git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" HEAD"

    Explanation of the above command : 

        --> git filter-branch: This Git command allows us to rewrite the history of our repository.
        --> --index-filter: This option specifies a command to filter the index (staging area) of each commit.
        --> git rm -rf --cached: This removes the .env file from the index (staging area) but not from the working directory.
        --> --ignore-unmatch: This option makes the command ignore errors if the file is not found in some commits.
        --> HEAD: This specifies that the filtering should apply to the current branch from the latest commit (HEAD).

3. git push --force

After rewriting the commit history, you need to force-push the changes to your remote repository. 
This command will overwrite the remote history with your local rewritten history.
